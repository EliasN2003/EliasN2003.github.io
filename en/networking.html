        <h2>University campus</h2>
        <p>In this design we have a network similar to what we would see in real life in big organizations. 
          Here we have 8 subnets out of which we use 5 of them. Large networks are often valnurable to component failures. 
          In this example if the main switch fails then the whole network will be unable to communicate with themselves or 
          the outside world. This is why we have 2 main switches so if one of them fails, the network will still be functional. 
          Same thing can also be done for the router. Note that all subnets in this example can communicate with each other with 
          static routing configured on their interfaces. If it's maximum security that we are after then we should avoid this 
          because if one subnet gets infected the attack will spread to the others. To prevent that, we isolate each subnet so 
          it can only communicate with the internet and not the other subnets.

        <h2>IOT Network</h2>
        <p>IOT stands for Internet Of Things and it's a critical innovation that we have in our service today. 
          Basically, every day devices can connect to your home network and communicate with your mobile device 
          giving you the ability to control them without being home. This helps if you want 
          to preheat the water on a cold winter day or turn on the AC remotely. This is what this 
          project is based on since you can turn on and off all home appliances with the smartphone.

        <h2>Web server</h2>
        <p>This design features a functioning web server that hosts a website that any user from network 1 (right) can 
          access. Network 2 (left) also has a DNS server that helps the user find the website by typing in its domain 
          name than the ip address of the website. The 2 routers communicate through RIP routing configured on 
          their CLI panel and also act as a DHCP server for their network.

        <h2>2 subnets</h2>
        <p>This network has been split in half and has created 2 smaller subnets. This process is called 
          subnetting and is very useful in networking because you can organize your networks better and save 
          valuable ip addresses you can use elsewhere. Also it adds an extra level of protection because you 
          can isolate your subnets so they can't communicate with each other and as a result 
          in the event that someone hacks into one subnet he will not have access to the other one immediately.
